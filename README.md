# Under (heavy) construction...

### Note to self
In order to test changes locally, modify and save necessary files, then run
```
git add .
git commit -m '[message]' #do not push
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
After that, look for a line that says `Server address: [some address]`, and view the local changes there.

*When wanting to apply changes to the live website, just run `git push`.*
