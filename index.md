  <p>I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at <a href="https://welcome.unicaen.fr/">UNICAEN</a>, in Caen, France.
  I work at the <a href="https://www.greyc.fr/en/home/">GREYC</a> lab, where I am part of the <a href="https://www.greyc.fr/en/equipes/amacc-2/">AMACC</a> team.</p>

  <p>Previously, I was a PhD student at <a href="https://lib.u-bourgogne.fr/en/home-page">LIB</a>
  (team <a href="https://lib.u-bourgogne.fr/combinatoire-et-reseaux">CombNet</a>) in Dijon, France, under the supervision of
  <a href="http://jl.baril.u-bourgogne.fr/"><nobr>Jean-Luc Baril</nobr></a>, <a href="https://kirgizov.link/"><nobr>Sergey Kirgizov</nobr></a>,
  and <a href="http://v.vincent.u-bourgogne.fr/"><nobr>Vincent Vajnovszki</nobr></a>. You can check both the
  <a href="https://hal.science/tel-04791004v3">thesis manuscript</a> and <nobr>the <a href="/pdf/diapoSoutenance.pdf">defence slides</a></nobr>.</p>

  <p>So far, I’ve been doing my research in the broad field of combinatorics. For a detailed description of my activity,

  <h1>Research</h1>
</div>

<p>During my PhD, I worked in the field of <em>enumerative</em> and <em>bijective</em> combinatorics. With the help of my supervisors,
I introduced a new class of lattice paths and studied a wide array of their elementary properties, such as their enumeration, their prefixes,
a right-to-left model, the distribution and popularity of several patterns, a couple subclasses and superclasses
(on which I conducted the same type of work)<nobr>, etc</nobr>. Each integer sequence arising from this work is a bijection waiting to be found
(a lot of them still elude me), and that is why I established a number of them in <a href="https://hal.science/tel-04791004v3">my manuscript</a>,
leading to interesting questions, like the transportation of combinatorial statistics through specific bijections.</p>

<p>My current postdoc introduced me to <em>analytic</em> combinatorics and the generation of large structures. At the moment,
I am trying to define interesting classes of directed acyclic graphs (or DAGs for short) in the vein of
<a href="https://courtiel.users.greyc.fr/">Julien Courtiel</a>’s and <a href="https://pepin231.users.greyc.fr/">Martin Pépin</a>’s
<a href="https://hal.science/hal-04487862v2">git graphs</a>. In this endeavour, the theory of analytic combinatorics aids me in finding asymptotic properties
of such classes and constructing efficient algorithms (namely, Boltzmann samplers) for the random generation of large graphs.</p>

<p>In the broader scheme of things, I greatly enjoy discrete structures, as well as adding new tools to my arsenal when studying them.</p>

  <h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
</div>

<p>There are several activities that are dear to my heart, including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Music (I especially love singing, and I dabble in a number of instruments, such as the trombone, the drums, the piano, and a few others);</li>
  <li>Video games (one genre I am particularly invested in are fighting games/platform fighters; I also used to play lots of rhythm games,
  and I've done speedruns of a couple platform games);</li>
  <li>Digital painting (although a beginner, I greatly appreciate the serenity and the sense of accomplishment that creating visual art brings).</li>
</ul>
